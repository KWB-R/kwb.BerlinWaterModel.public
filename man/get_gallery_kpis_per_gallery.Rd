\title{Extract aggregated KPIs per gallery from a lookup table}
\usage{
get_gallery_kpis_per_gallery(lookup)
}
\arguments{
\item{lookup}{A tibble with columns \code{waterworks}, \code{gallery} and
a list-column \code{kpis} as returned by \code{compute_gallery_kpis()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per gallery, containing all aggregated KPIs
from \code{kpis$per_gallery} and the identifying columns
\code{waterworks} and \code{gallery}.
}
\description{
Helper to flatten the nested \code{kpis$per_gallery} entries from
\code{ww_galleries_lookup} (or a similar lookup table) into a single tibble.
}
\details{
This returns one row per gallery with all aggregated KPIs that were computed
over the full observation period (e.g. \code{MQA}, \code{NQA}, \code{HQA},
\code{MNQA}, \code{NNQA}, \code{MHQA}, \code{HHQA}, \code{MQ365},
\code{HQ365}, \code{MQ1Ist}, \code{MQ30}, ...).

Any \code{waterworks} or \code{gallery} columns inside \code{per_gallery}
are dropped to avoid name clashes; the outer ID columns are kept.
